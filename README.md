# Embedded Systems forge

In this website you will find all kind of interesting facts that I found in my journey as a Embedded Software Engineer. I will go deep into some basic knowledge of Linux and I use the industry-standard Yocto project as Build tool to compile customize Linux OS into known boards that you could buy like RBPi4.

You will find here basic knowledge that may exists already on internet but it is not easy to find or at least, it was not easy to find for me when I started as Junior in Belden Inc. Any of the information that you will find here is proprietary in any way, I do have extra care to any information that it is vital for the companies that I work with.

All the code that you will find here could be used in your own projects as an starting point. I will love to here from you if any article or tutorial in this website was in any help, or if you want to discuss why I do think this would be the 'right' approach for certain problems that most of us have had when coding using Yocto.

### Installation

```bash
npx
```

### Local Development

```bash
# root of website
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
# root of website
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
